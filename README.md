# WIFI_kit_32_dpf
Displays DPF status information on the WIFI_kit_32 device.

The device has only been tested with the Audi A4 B8 2.0 with CAGA engine and the iCar2 Vgate interface.

The premise of the project was to use an ESP32 module with an attached OLED display.

I found two solutions for my project: 

* WIFI_kit_32 
* WeMos Lolin32 OLED

The program is prepared for both boards.
